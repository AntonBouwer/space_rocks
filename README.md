# Space Rocks - an Asteroids clone

Space Rocks is an Asteroids clone based on the course provided by Real Python.  
Course: https://realpython.com/lessons/asteroids-game-overview/  

I'm using the course to learn pygame as well as learn how to properly structure  
pygame projects.

## Update 2023-05-18
The basic game is now complete; additional things to do include:
* Adding additional "lives"
* Adding scoring
* High score?
* Increasing difficulty (more rocks, faster movement)
* Power ups?
* Instant replay?

Also, given the basic structure of the game, it may be fun to try  this in Godot.
